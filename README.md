# 🧠 My Journey in understanding Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository documents my continuous journey in mastering **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using **Java**.  
The goal is to strengthen problem-solving, improve logical thinking, and prepare for advanced software development.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To build a solid foundation in DSA by understanding how data is organized, accessed, and optimized — not just memorized.  
Each topic will be learned through practical coding, visualization, and analysis.

---

## 🧩 Current Focus

- Strengthening logic with arrays and loops  
- Avoiding common pitfalls (like out-of-bounds errors)  
- Learning how to trace and visualize algorithm flow  
- Writing clean, efficient, and readable code  

---

## ⚙️ Tools & Environment

- **Language:** Java  
- **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA / VS Code  
- **Version:** Java 17+  

---

## 🧭 Learning Approach

1. **Understand before coding** — logic first, syntax second.  
2. **Visualize algorithms** — trace with dry runs and flow understanding.  
3. **Iterate for clarity** — refine code for simplicity and readability.  
4. **Document progress** — every topic will include explanations and notes.  

---

## 🚀 Vision

To reach a level where algorithmic thinking becomes second nature
where every problem can be broken down logically, structured efficiently,  
and solved with confidence.
