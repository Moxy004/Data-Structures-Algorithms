# 🧠 My Journey in understanding Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository documents my continuous journey in mastering **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using **Java**.  
The goal is to strengthen problem-solving, improve logical thinking, and prepare for advanced software development.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To build a solid foundation in DSA by understanding how data is organized, accessed, and optimized not just memorized.  
Each topic will be learned through practical coding, visualization, and analysis.

---

## 🚀 Vision

To reach a level where algorithmic thinking becomes second nature
where every problem can be broken down logically, structured efficiently,  
and solved with confidence.
